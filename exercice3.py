'''
Write a function (run_timing) that asks how long it took for you to run 10 km.
The function continues to ask how long (in minutes) it took for additional runs, until the user presses Enter.
At that point, the function exitsâ€”but only after calculating and displaying the average time that the 10 km runs took.
