'''
Write a function called pl_sentence that takes a string containing several words, separated by spaces.
(To make things easier, we wonâ€™t actually ask for a real sentence.
More specifically, there will be no capital letters or punctuation.)
So, if someone were to call pl_sentence('this is a test translation') the output would be histay isway away estay ranslationtay
Print the output on a single line, rather than with each word on a separate line.
